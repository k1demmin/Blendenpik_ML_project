  <h3 align="center">Blendenpik_project_for_CSCI6961</h3>

    This is the github for our ML project on the BLENDENPIK method presented in the paper by Avron et al. 
    It contains the main code of the Blendenpik object. Constructed Via several parameters and matrices. 
    Each of the other code files is an experiment or supporting code for the experiments.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our group looked into the paper titled \textit{Blendenpik: Supercharging Lapack's Least-Squares Solver}. 
This paper was written by Haim Avron, Petar Maymounkov, and Sivan Toledo and was published in the SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing in January 2010.
The algorithm developed in this paper, Blendenpik, uses preconditioning and iterative solvers to solve the least-squares problem, which by itself is not novel. 
However, Blendenpik takes a randomized approach to building its preconditioning matrix, which speeds up the algorithm greatly and makes it more than competitive 
with LAPACK.
